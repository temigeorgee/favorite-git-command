             A GitHub branch is used to work with different versions of a
             repository at the same time. There is the default branch, also known
             as the master branch while creating a repository, and other branches
             for development.New Branches are for bug fixes and feature work
             separate from the master branch. When changes are ready, they can be
             merged into the master branch. If you make changes to the master
             branch while working on a new branch, these updates can be pulled in.
            </p>

             One would ask, How can you create a branch? When do you use git branch? How do you use it? Well ..
             In other to create a branch, we need type git branch in the terminal. so as to see a list of all your branches.
             there would be a single branch called <em>master</em>.
             This is the default branch for all Git repositories. <br>
             Usage: <b> git branch </b><br>

            <p>
             To create a new branch we use the <em>git checkout</em> command with the -b flag(where '-' is enforce and 'b' is branch) and then pass in a name of a branch. <br>
             Usage: <strong>git checkout -b NAME_OF_BRANCH</strong><br>
             <img src="create new branch.png" alt=" html file">
            </p>
            <p>
             Prehaps, we want to move to another branch that has been created before, we use the git checkout command and then state the name of a branch. <br>
             Usage: git <b>checkout NAME_OF_BRANCH</b> <br>
             <img src="checkout.PNG" alt="html doc">   
            </p>
            <div>
                <p>
                    To delete a branch, we leave that branch and then run git branch -D (where D is delete) <br>
                    Usage:<b>git branch -D NAME_OF_BRANCH</b> <br>
                    <img src="delete.PNG" alt="html doc">
                </p>
                <p>
                    To see all of the branches we created, we can type <em>git branch -a</em>.(where 'a' is all).
                    The -a flag will include remote branches (branches on GitHub or other remote locations).  <br>
                    Usage: <b>git branch -a</b> <br>
